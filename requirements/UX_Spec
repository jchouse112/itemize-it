Based on the code provided and the architecture we established, here is the UX & Interaction Specification (v1.0).This document bridges the gap between your Data Schema (how data is stored) and your React Native Code (how it looks). It leans heavily into the "Industrial/Contractor" aesthetic visible in your code (bg-asphalt, text-safety-orange).Itemize-It (II) — UX & Interaction SpecificationTheme: "Precision Industrial" — High contrast, large touch targets, tactile feedback.Target Device: Mobile First (One-handed usage focus).1. Design System & TokensDerived from your _layout.tsx and component files.1.1 Color PaletteTokenHexUsageSurface (Dark)#0F1115 (Asphalt)Main background. Reduces glare in low light.Surface (Light)#1C1F26 (Gunmetal)Cards, Modals, Form inputs.Primary#FF5F00 (Safety Orange)Primary actions (FAB, Submit), Active states.Success#10B981 (Emerald)"Business/Project" classification, Money In.Neutral#9CA3AF (Concrete)Secondary text, inactive icons.Border#374151 (Edge Steel)Dividers, Borders (1px).1.2 Typography rulesHeaders: Sans-serif, Bold. (e.g., "Jobs & Clients").Body: Sans-serif, Regular.Numbers/Currency: Monospace (font-mono) with tabular-nums variant.Why: Ensures decimal points align vertically in lists (seen in DashboardScreen).1.3 Feedback (Haptics)Success/Scan: Light Impact (Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light)).Swipe Classification: Medium Impact.Error/Delete: Heavy Impact or Notification (NotificationFeedbackType.Error).2. Navigation & User Flows2.1 The "Capture" Loop (Primary Flow)Goal: Speed. From pocket to "Processing" in < 5 seconds.Dashboard (Home):FAB (Floating Action Button): Fixed at bottom (BigTrigger).Interaction: Tap opens camera immediately (No modal selection unless long-pressed).Scan Screen (scan.tsx):Viewfinder: Edge-to-edge camera.Overlay: "Pulse" animation on the frame (already implemented via Reanimated).Feedback: When image is captured -> Flash screen white -> Haptic "Click" -> Auto-advance.The "Chopping Block" (Queue):Shows the captured image thumbnail + "Processing..." badge.Background upload starts immediately (Offline Queue logic).2.2 The "Split & Classify" Loop (The USP)Goal: Handle the "Mixed Receipt" scenario without a spreadsheet.Item Card Stack (split.tsx):Visual: Tinder-style card stack. Current item in focus, next item peeking behind.Data: Displays Description + Amount (Large font).Gestures:Swipe Right: Personal (Icon: User, Color: Gray).Swipe Left: Business/Project (Icon: Briefcase, Color: Emerald).Tap Card: Opens Detail/Split Editor (See 3.1).Completion:When stack is empty, show "Summary Report" (Total Personal vs. Business).Auto-close after 2 seconds or "Done" button.3. Complex Interaction Specs3.1 The "Split Editor" (Manual Split)Context: The user taps a line item because it needs to be split 50/50.Entry: Tap on the active card in split.tsx.UI: Modal Sheet (Bottom 50%).Inputs:Row A (Business): Numeric Input. Focus defaults here.Row B (Personal): Read-only (Auto-calculated).Logic: Row B = Total - Row A.Visual Aid:If Row A > Total: Turn input border Red + Shake animation."Remaining": Displayed in small text between inputs.Action: "Confirm Split" button replaces the single card with two new cards in the stack.3.2 Offline StatesDashboard:Show "Offline Mode" banner (Thin strip, Orange) under header.Project totals dim (indicating potentially stale data).Capture:Fully functional.After capture, show toast: "Saved to Queue. Will upload when online."4. Component States (React Native Specifics)4.1 The "Project Card" (ProjectCard.tsx)Default: bg-gunmetal, border-edge-steel.Pressed: Scale down 0.98, bg-edge-steel (Active opacity).Over Budget: If spent > budget:Change Progress Bar color to Red.Change Spent Text color to Red.4.2 The "Big Trigger" (Add Expense)Location: Bottom of Dashboard.Style: bg-safety-orange, rounded, full width.Shadow: Heavy drop shadow (shadow-lg, shadow-black).Animation: On press, button depresses (translateY +2px) and shadow reduces.5. Accessibility (a11y)Touch Targets: Minimum 44x44pt for all interactive elements.Text Scaling: All text inside Text components must use dynamic type scaling (avoid fixed heights on cards).Screen Readers:Swipe View: Must explicitly announce actions.Label: "Lumber, $45.00. Swipe left for Project, Right for Personal, Double tap to split."6. Implementation Checklist (Next Steps)Based on your current code, here is the immediate UX "To-Do" list:Gesture Handler: Add react-native-gesture-handler to split.tsx. The current implementation uses buttons; you need actual Swiping for the "Tinder" feel.Haptics: Install expo-haptics and trigger impactAsync on the button presses in split.tsx and capture in scan.tsx.Keyboard Avoidance: Wrap the inputs in the future Manual Split modal with KeyboardAvoidingView (behavior="padding").Skeleton Loading: Create a skeleton placeholder for MOCK_PROJECTS while the app fetches real data from the DB.Diagram: The Classification FlowTo visualize the "Chopping Block" logic:This spec gives you the rules of the road for the UI. You already have the Split screen scaffolded; the next big task is adding the Gesture logic and the Math modal.
